Textrategia team hello,

in order to run the server you need to enter the directory that
holds 'script.js' and type the following:

'nodemon server.js'

Before hitting 'Enter' be sure to see that your MySQL server is UP AND RUNNING, 
in the same breath - make sure you have all tables initited.

If you're not sure to wether you have all tables or data complete the following steps:
1.Enter the folder "DB"
2.Open the file 'drop_db' in MySQL.
3.Run the single line (hit the lightning butten).
4.Now open the file 'DB_Scheme' in MySQL.
5.Run the file using the lightning button.
6.Now open the file 'Instances for DB' in MySQL.
7.Run the file using the lightning button.

You are now ready.
